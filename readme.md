## a new way to expierence windows
----
Windows has a ton of bloatware and it's hard to remove everything. Well that's where matte windows comes in here is what it will do.

---
Matte removes:
- bloatware and disables useless services
- prevent windows apps from starting automatically
- removed compiler and recall
- removes Xbox game manager and Microsoft store
- removes any trace of windows spying on you and disables windows spying on you

Matte changes/adds:
- windows start menu
- replaces all default apps with open source ones
- adds a top bar instead of using the default annoying desktop switcher
- adds a better settings (coming soon)

----
Current status: working on it
