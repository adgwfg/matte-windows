This project will be based on atlas os you could use regular windows as there will be no problems with that but its recommended to use atlasos (https://atlasos.net).

This project will be a recreation of end4 dots on windows (with its own spin).

The project is currently being actively made and is scheduled not to released next year but this year (2025)

# todo (working on)
- constant borders (this adds a small gapps between the app and the app like)
- better quick menu (will come after release)
- improving the yasb config file (might switch to glazewm due to some stuff)


# needed help with
- improving komorebi animations for config
- cleaning the yasb file (there is a lot of junk there since i based it off the default config)
